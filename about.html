        <h1>GREENSBORO</h1>
        <h3> Dear Greensboro, </h3>
         <p>It started in 1985 with a vision, twelve counselors, ninety campers and four friends of mine: Johnny Dawkins, Ralph Sampson, David Henderson and Michael Jordan. The idea was to combine my passion for books and basketball, and give children the chance to see for themselves that with hard work and good decision-making, there is no limit to the things they can achieve. Thus was born Achievements Unlimited Basketball School (AU).</p>
         <p>It has been an amazing journey for me and the AU family. Over the past 25 years, with the unwavering support of my hometown, AU has grown to be a staple in the Greensboro community. Together, we have been able to give more than 8,500 children the opportunity to spend a week with us learning the game of basketball, the importance of education, and the value of living a life free of drugs and alcohol.</p>
         <p>This year, I have decided to pass the AU- Greensboro torch to the National Basketball Academy. On behalf of the Charlotte Bobcats, the National Basketball Academy will run specially developed youth basketball programs including camps, clinics, tournaments, leagues and youth basketball training beginning this spring. To learn more about the National Basketball Academy, visit www.thebasketballacademy.com.</p>
        <p>I have worked with the National Basketball Academy for over a year to develop Bobcats branded programming that will grow to span North and South Carolina including my hometown of Greensboro. I am excited about their vision for Greensboro and look forward to my hometown supporting them just as they have supported AU.</p>
        <p>I am excited and eager to continue AU’s yearly tradition. I can’t thank you enough for the years of support for AU-Greensboro and as always, my heart will belong to you.</p>
